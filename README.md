<h2> Overview </h2>

This Python script allows you to create a backup of the current directory in the parent directory. The script creates a backup directory in the parent directory, and then archives the contents of the current directory into a ZIP file with the name of the current directory. The backup file is saved in the backup directory with a single .zip extension.
<br>
The script can be used to easily backup the contents of a directory before making changes or updates to the files. This can be especially useful if you're working on a project and want to make sure you have a backup copy of your files in case something goes wrong.
<h2>Usage</h2>

To use the script, simply download the backup.py file and run it using Python:
```bash
python backup.py
```
You will find the backup file in the backup directory that is created in the parent directory.
